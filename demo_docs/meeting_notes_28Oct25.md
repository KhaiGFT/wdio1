## **1Ô∏è‚É£ How to capture the element locator?**
We can capture element locators in multiple ways ‚Äî no dependency on the developer team as long as each element has a unique attribute.

### üîπ **Web Example**
```js
// By ID
const username = $('#userId');

// By name
const username = $('[name="userId"]');

// By CSS selector
const loginBtn = $('button.login-btn');

// By text (XPath)
const submit = $('//button[text()="Submit"]');
```

### üîπ **Mobile Example**
```js
// By Accessibility ID
const loginButton = $('~loginButton');

// By resource-id (Android)
const username = $('id:com.bankapp.android:id/username');

// By class and text
const label = $('//android.widget.TextView[@text="Welcome"]');

// By iOS name attribute
const passwordField = $('//XCUIElementTypeTextField[@name="password"]');
```

‚û°Ô∏è *We can identify elements independently using attributes like `id`, `text`, `content-desc`, or `accessibilityId` without waiting for developer changes.*

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ How to write a test case using our framework (Live coding)**
We will demonstrate this in the live session:  
- Create a new test file using our WebdriverIO + TypeScript template.  
- Implement a simple scenario (e.g., login test).  
- Execute and show Allure report generation.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ How automation saves manual tester effort (Pain-point)**
Manual testing works fine for small projects, but as systems scale, re-running hundreds of test cases manually becomes inefficient.

‚û°Ô∏è **Key idea:**
- For small projects ‚Üí limited ROI initially.  
- As features grow ‚Üí automation greatly reduces regression time and catches side-effect issues earlier.

| Task | Manual Effort | Automated Effort | Saving |
|------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Regression (50 test cases) | ~2 days | ~1 hour | ~90% saved |
| Cross-browser verification | ~1 day | ~20 min | ~85% saved |

> Automation lets testers focus on exploratory and high-value testing instead of repeating routine checks.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Benefits of automation test**
- Faster regression and release cycles.  
- Consistent test execution with fewer human errors.  
- Easy scaling across browsers and devices.  
- Reusable scripts and long-term cost efficiency.  

> ‚ÄúAutomation provides faster delivery, higher accuracy, and sustainable cost reduction over time.‚Äù

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison: WebdriverIO vs Java (Selenium + TestNG + Cucumber)**

| Criteria | WebdriverIO | Java (Selenium + TestNG + Cucumber) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Setup time | ~1 hour | 3‚Äì4 hours |
| Config complexity | Low (simple configs) | High (manual XML setup) |
| Code verbosity | TypeScript (clean) | Java (verbose) |
| Parallel execution | Built-in | Needs plugin |
| CI/CD integration | Native support | Manual setup |
| Community support | Large & active | Moderate |

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Change ‚Äúlarge community‚Äù wording**
> ‚ÄúBecause WebdriverIO is backed by a strong open-source community, we can quickly find and reuse proven solutions ‚Äî reducing both issue resolution time and licensing cost.‚Äù

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ How can we do automation testing on a high-security banking app?**

- **Run Tests Inside SIT Environment (Secure & Controlled)**  
  All automation tests are executed inside the bank‚Äôs SIT network. Sensitive data never leaves the secured environment, and test results are stored internally under access control.

- **Use Appium on Standard Banking App (Without Breaking Security)**  
  Appium uses official OS testing frameworks ‚Äî **UIAutomator2** (Android) and **XCUITest** (iOS).  
  These frameworks are **built-in and approved by Google and Apple**, meaning automation runs **like a real user**, not through code injection or modification.  
  Therefore, **developers should not disable UIAutomator or XCUITest** on the testing build; otherwise, no legitimate testing (manual or automated) can inspect or interact with UI elements.
